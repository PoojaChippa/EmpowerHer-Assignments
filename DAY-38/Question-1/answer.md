### Understanding Project Management in NodeJS

## a. Package Managers

# What is a package manager?

A package manager is a program or application used to assist developers install, update, uninstall and manage external libraries (packages) needed to develop a project. These packages offer instant functionality such that developers are not required to code everything.

# Why would we have package managers in the back-end development?

1. There are numerous external libraries on which the backend projects rely.

2. They can save the development time because they are reusing the existing code.

3. They provide stable versions of dependencies.

4. They make the setting up of the project easier to other developers.

# Problems faced if package managers are not used:

1. Libraries have to be downloaded and managed manually by the developers.

2. Application errors may occur because of version differences.

3. The process of project setup is tedious and prone to errors.

4. It becomes hard to track dependency.

5. Cooperation between developers is more difficult.

====================================

## b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

# What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install and manage JavaScript libraries used in Node.js applications.

# Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

1. Supplies access to thousands of reusable packages.

2. Installation of dependency automatic.

3. Helps to handle project versions.

4. Environments Make backend development accelerated and more dependable.

# How NPM helps in managing dependencies

1. Automatic evocation of necessary packages.

2. Dependency information should be stored in package.json.

3. Locking the versions with package-lock.json.

4. It is simple to update or remove packages with the help of commands.

# Example:

npm install express

====================================

## c.Backend Project Initialization

# What is the command used to initialize a backend (Node.js) project?

npm init

# What does npm init do?

1. Starts an interactive setup.

2. Enquires about project information such as name, version and entry file.

3. Produces a package.json that is related to user input.

# What does npm init -y do?

1. Skips all questions.

2. Creates package.json automatically (with default values).

3. Saves time during project setup.

## d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

# 1. package.json

- Purpose:

1. Stores project metadata.

2. Lists dependencies and scripts.

3. Defines project configuration.

- Importance:

1. Required to install dependencies.

2. Acts as the project’s identity file.

# 2. node_modules

- Purpose:

1. Contains all installed dependency packages.

- Importance:

1. Required for application execution.

2. Automatically generated by NPM.

# 3. package-lock.json

- Purpose:

1. Records exact versions of installed dependencies.

- Importance:

1. Ensures consistent installations across systems.

2. Prevents version-related issues.

## Which files/folders should not be pushed to GitHub and why

- 1. node_modules/

. Very large in size.

. Can be regenerated using npm install.

. Makes repositories heavy and slow.

## Which files MUST be committed and why?

1.  package.json

- Defines project dependencies and scripts

2. package-lock.json

- Ensures dependency consistency

3. Source code files

- Core logic of the application
