Why is cascade delete better handled at the database level instead of the application level?

Answer:

Cascade delete is better handled at the database level because the database automatically maintains data consistency.
When a parent record is deleted, the database ensures all related child records are removed safely and completely.
This prevents orphan data, reduces extra code in the application, and guarantees correct behavior even if the application crashes or forgets to delete related data.
